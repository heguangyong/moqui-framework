While there are community resources elsewhere (GitHub, LinkedIn, Stack Overflow) the primary community tools for all projects in the Moqui Ecosystem are here on moqui.org and run on Moqui using the HiveMind application. This includes documentation in the wiki, issues and other requests, and tasks for development planning and collaboration among core contributors.

Over time we plan to improve Moqui and HiveMind to do more on moqui.org. Code repositories will stay on GitHub but we may add integration through the GitHub API to pull in information about commits, releases, etc.

The use of Moqui and HiveMind is still a work in progress, partly with the intent to improve Moqui and HiveMind over time to benefit community collaboration along with anyone who is using Moqui and/or HiveMind. If you run into issues please report them (as requests for support or bug fix here on moqui.org under the Moqui Web Site project).

All documentation for Moqui is available right here on moqui.org.

The main framework documentation for many years was the book Making Apps with Moqui (also in Chinese) but it was written in 2014 and is outdated. All content from this book has been migrated to the wiki here on moqui.org and is available under the Documentation tab.

If you would like to help with documentation please create an account here on moqui.org and request write/update access to the HiveMind PM application. Please understand that some level of trust is necessary for this, so if you are brand new to Moqui please start by participating in forum discussions and mailing lists.

Peer support resources are available to help us all help each other. Please understand that people who might respond are voluneers, people just like you, and Moqui is a community (not company) backed open source project. If you need more timely or consistent support, or support is more than a question on a specific topic, consider hiring a Service Provider to help you.

Moqui Forum (this is the primary community collaboration resource)

Stack Overflow (large audience, meant for questions)

If you are not sure whether you have a question or want to discuss something, feel free to use the Comments and Discussions resources.

The Moqui Forum site is the primary resource for collaboration within the community of Moqui users and contributors. This site runs on Discourse and has significant content that is also useful to supplement the documentation.

A special thanks to Michael Jones for setting up and hosting this forum.

Mailing Lists (previous collaboration resources, somewhat active, also get commit notifications)

LinkedIn Group (less active, larger audience, more general topics)

To submit a request for support, bug fix, new feature, etc use the My Requests screen in the My Account app here on moqui.org. You may also comment on and edit your requests there.

When creating requests please always select a Project for the part of Moqui that your request is for, and the request Type that best matches what you have in mind. Please also read and follow the guidlines in the Issue and Pull Request Guide.

For core contributors who have write access to the HiveMind PM app you can also create requests there, as well as review and comment on requests from others.

To report security issues that should not be disclosed publicly before they are fixed, please use the private [email protected] mailing list. This is setup so that anyone can send messages to it, but only members of the group can read the messages.

All source code for Moqui Ecosystem projects is hosted on GitHub.

While requests (issues, etc) and tasks for planning are here on moqui.org code contributions must be submitted as pull requests on GitHub. See the Contributors Guide and the Issue and Pull Request Guide for more detail.

Tasks for planned development, especially those involving collaboration among various community members, are in HiveMind PM right here on moqui.org.

You can create an account on moqui.org to get immediate view only access to the HiveMind PM application and full view/update access to the My Account application where you can submit requests (issues, etc) and more. If you want to be more involved in one or more of the Moqui projects or help with documentation please request write/update access to HiveMind PM.

- Mantle Business Artifacts

Comments? Questions? Get Involved? Join the Forum

Mantle Business Artifacts is an open source project separate from and built on Moqui Framework. Moqui Framework is a set of tools to build applications. Mantle Business Artifact is a library of lower-level artifacts that act as a foundation for business applications. The main benefits of using Mantle are cost savings, design and implementation risk reduction, adoption of common and standardized business structures and processes, and consistency with other applications built on Moqui and Mantle.

Mantle has three main parts: Universal Data Model (UDM), Universal Service Library (USL), and Universal Business Process Library (UBPL).

UBPL is a set of business process stories and other generic business requirement documents that drive the design of business applications. They are a good source for understanding the business concepts, actors, and processes that the data model and service library are based on. They are also generic enough to be used as a starting point for real-world business and modified as needed.

Mantle is a foundation for building enterprise automation applications such as:

Together Moqui Framework and Mantle Business Artifacts form a foundation for an ecosystem of applications that are implicitly integrated. Applications can extend the Mantle data model and will always have their own services, but using the data model and services as intended will make applications work readily with data and services from other applications built on the same.

When such applications are deployed together the data is automatically shared. For example you will have a single structure for customer data that is used across all ecommerce, customer service, fulfillment, project management, and accounting applications and any other types of application that needs it.

NOTE: This section uses a large number of business terms. If you run across terms you are not familiar with you may look them up as you go (the internet is a wonderful thing, as is the full text search of the digital version of this book) or just take note of them, move on, and don’t worry too much about each one. The Mantle Structure and UDM section goes through a lot of terms with only data structures as context. When you get to the USL Business Processes section you will see the terms used in context of a process along with examples and they may make more sense, especially if you have spent some time reading about the data structures.

An open source project, or an ecosystem of open source projects like Moqui, only exists because of contributions. This is especially important for unfunded, community-driven open source projects that have no corporate backing. While there are many individuals and organizations doing business based on Moqui projects there is no single entity that owns or controls the code, business artifacts, documentation, etc.

That's all great, but what do I get from contributing?

Under the moderation model used for all Moqui Ecosystem projects a moderator is an individual with write (push) access to one or more repositories. Many open source organizations use the term committer for those with write access. The term moderator implies more than just being a committer. A moderator is a member of the core group responsible for the overall health and quality of the code including considerations like backward compatibility and applicability to a wide variety of technical and business requirements going beyond the concerns of any particular project or product based on the open source code.

Moderators are added by invitation only. To be invited simply contribute over time by doing the following:

Issues and pull requests are the primary form of contribution for most users and are a vital part of making software better. The Moqui Ecosystem projects are operated using a moderator model to help maintain high quality code with consistent and reliable behavior.

Moderators have a number of concerns to consider for each issue and pull requests:

High quality issues contain adequate information to quickly and easily understand and reproduce. The same applies to pull requests. Issues that can't be reproduced won't be fixed. Pull requests that can't be tested won't be merged.

As with any open source project it is a volunteer (unpaid) effort to research and fix issues, and sometimes even more effort to research, test, and offer feedback on pull requests. The easier you make it to understand, reproduce, and test your issue or pull request the more likely it is to be resolved in a timely manner (or at all).

To report security issues that should not be disclosed publicly before they are fixed, please use the private [email protected] mailing list. This is setup so that anyone can send messages to it, but only members of the group can read the messages.

All issues and pull requests should include this information. Please consider that collaborating remotely requires a lot more detail than in person and it is best to include detail up front rather than waiting for a clarifying question from a moderator.

Please stick to facts and avoid theories about what is happening or why. Software is generally deterministic so a given starting state and input will always result in a consistent ending state and/or output. If you are having trouble finding the cause of an issue or fixes aren't making a difference, the first step is to question theories, research code, and run tests as needed to prove or disprove theories.

It is okay to describe why you think this is happening and what you think could be done to fix it, but please understand that a moderator will never accept your explanation and act on it without reproducing the issue, doing whatever is needed to fix it, and testing the result.

The information needed to implement new features varies a lot more from feature to feature than for bugs and general issues so what we need is more fluid. The key for new features is describing context. If you haven't yet read the Introduction => Context section near the top of this document please do so now.

Before suggesting a new feature please do research on existing and related functionality that already exists, and reference it in your request. This can be helpful to establish context and is an opportunity to describe what you need in terms of how it varies from what already exists. This is critical if the new feature is an enhancement to existing functionality, and is helpful even if it is entirely new.

If you want to contribute large and complex new features it is often best to first implement them in a separate component that can be deployed as an add on, even if the intention is to add it to an existing component such as mantle-usl, SimpleScreens, PopCommerce, etc. The framework picks up services in any component, and even screens can be mounted in the screen tree of existing applications using database records.
